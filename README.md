#  SDR FM Receiver

SDR FM Receiver is a software-defined radio system built on a Raspberry Pi 4 with an RF dongle for real-time reception of FM mono/stereo audio and RDS (Radio Data System) data. It replaces traditional radio hardware components with flexible, reconfigurable software to process and decode live radio signals.

##  Features

-  **FM Demodulation**  
  Extracts mono, stereo, and RDS sub-channels (0–100 kHz) from raw RF samples.

-  **Mono Audio Processing**  
  Low-pass filtering and resampling for clear 48 kHz audio playback.

-  **Stereo Audio Processing**  
  Uses PLL-based stereo pilot recovery, band-pass filtering, and resampling to separate left and right channels.

-  **RDS Decoding**  
  Demodulates and extracts embedded digital information (station name, program ID, song metadata).

-  **Resampler & FIR Filtering**  
  Efficient block processing with linear-phase FIR filters for clean and stable audio.

-  **Real-Time Reception**  
  Processes I/Q samples from RF hardware and outputs live FM audio in real time.

##  Tech Stack

-  **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi 4, RTL-SDR dongle, antenna  
-  **Languages:** C++, Python  
-  **Core DSP Components:** FIR filters, PLL, resampling, FM demodulator  
-  **Tools:** Git, custom DSP implementations in C++/Python  

##  Performance Metrics

-  1111–1313 multiplications per output sample for mono processing (mode-dependent)
-  +102 multiplications per sample for stereo processing
-  Accurate RDS carrier recovery and symbol resampling achieved
-  Stereo resampling and PLL runtime: ~6.4–10.2 ms per block depending on mode

##  Future Improvements

-  Add a user interface to display signal strength, station metadata, and song information
-  Optimize runtime with multi-threading for simultaneous stereo and RDS processing
-  Reduce memory usage by eliminating redundant vectors and allocations
